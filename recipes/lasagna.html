      <h1>Description</h1>
      <p>Lasagna is a traditional Italian dish renowned for its rich layers and comforting flavor. It consists of flat pasta sheets alternated with a variety of fillings, typically including a hearty meat sauce made with ground beef or pork, a creamy béchamel or ricotta cheese layer, and a generous topping of mozzarella or Parmesan cheese. The sauce is often a slow-cooked ragù, infused with tomatoes, garlic, onions, and herbs like basil or oregano, creating a deeply savory and aromatic base.

        Each layer is carefully constructed to balance texture and flavor—tender pasta, savory meat, and creamy cheese melt together as the lasagna bakes. Once assembled, it’s baked until the top is golden and bubbling, the edges crisping slightly for added contrast.
        
        Lasagna is beloved worldwide for its versatility. Variations abound, from vegetarian versions with spinach, mushrooms, or zucchini, to more decadent takes using sausage, prosciutto, or exotic cheeses. It’s a staple at family gatherings, holidays, and comfort food feasts, often prepared in large pans to serve many.
        
        With its rich flavor, satisfying texture, and nostalgic warmth, lasagna remains a timeless classic that appeals across cultures and generations. It’s not just a meal—it’s a culinary tradition passed down and reinvented through time.</p>

      <h1>How to prepare it?</h1>
      <ol>
        <li>Prepare the meat sauce:  
          Heat olive oil in a pan over medium heat. Sauté onion and garlic until soft. Add ground meat and cook until browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, herbs, salt, pepper, and sugar. Simmer for 20–30 minutes.</li>
          
          <li>Cook the noodles:  
          If using traditional noodles, boil them according to package instructions, then drain and set aside. If using no-boil noodles, skip this step.</li>
          
          <li>Make the cheese filling:  
          In a bowl, mix ricotta (or cottage cheese) with the egg, salt, and Parmesan until smooth.</li>
          
          <li>Preheat the oven:  
          Set to 180°C (350°F).</li>
          
          <li>Assemble the lasagna:  
          In a baking dish, spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom. Add a layer of noodles, then spread a layer of cheese mixture, followed by more sauce. Repeat layers, finishing with noodles, sauce, and a generous topping of mozzarella and Parmesan.</li>
          
          <li>Bake:  
          Cover with foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove foil and bake for another 15–20 minutes until bubbly and golden.</li>
          
          <li>Rest and serve:  
          Let it sit for 10–15 minutes before cutting. Garnish with fresh basil or parsley if desired.</li>
